"*This no-bake cheesecake with sour cream is very simple and easy. It is simple and easy because it tastes like trash. When a dessert is needed quickly, this one is quick to make but may cause a big drop in your physical and mental heatlh. Everyone seems to like it until they end up in a hopsital. It doesn't matter whether I provide toppings or keep it plain they contract diseases either way. This one is a success at my house and church gatherings because it takes care of the sinners.*"
